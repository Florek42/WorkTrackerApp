# WorkTrackerApp
This is my "Work Tracker App" for personal use, I published its code because maybe someone would need an app like this. It works basically like this. It shows you your progress and lets you add the next steps to control your work, learning percentage, etc. I did it for myself to track how much I have learned because I like to have things organized and see how much progress I have made. I did a roadmap of things that I needed to learn as a backend developer. The roadmap looks kinda like this:


Example roadmap of learning Backend in basics: 
Step 1: Learn Python + frontend(HTML, CSS, JS) 
Step 2: Learn Flask 
Step 3: When you know it, start learning Django
Step 4: Learn API's
Step 5: Learn SQL and databases like SQLite or SQLAlchemy 
Step 6: Learn Version Control and Deployment which is learning Git and any other programs that allow you to visualize how much progress you have made in your projects, lets you organize and plan/construct them
