# WorkTrackerApp
This is my "Work Tracker App" for personal use, I published its code because maybe someone would need an app like this. It works basically like this. It shows you your progress and lets you add the next steps to control your work, learning percentage, etc. I did it for myself to track how much I have learned because I like to have things organized and see how much progress I have made. I did a roadmap of things that I needed to learn as a backend developer.
